[Download](https://onshape-download.develar.org/download) Onshape standalone app ([release notes](https://github.com/develar/onshape-desktop-shell/releases/latest)).

“[Onshape](http://example.com/) is the first and only full-cloud 3D CAD system that lets everyone on a design team simultaneously work together using a web browser, phone or tablet. CAD Anywhere, Anytime, On Any Device.”

So, there is no official desktop application since you can use Onshape on a desktop computer using web browser.

But using web browser in this case is not always convenient — you lost all standard ways to open app or to switch to it.
What if you want to easily switch to Onshape using cmd+tab? And not to lose Onshape among other web pages?

Please note – it is unofficial application.

# Installation
## OS X
Nothing special. Just [download](https://onshape-download.develar.org/download/osx), double click to mount it and drag the application icon to the `/Applications` folder. 

After the app is dragged to your Applications folder, you can run it normally — from the Finder, Launchpad, Spotlight, dock, or anything else. The first time you open a downloaded application, you’ll see a warning. Agree to open the file and you won’t see the warning again. See [short](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1171/how-do-i-install-an-application-from-a-dmg-disk-image) or [long](http://www.howtogeek.com/177619/how-to-install-applications-on-a-mac-everything-you-need-to-know/) (“DMG Files" section”) guide.

You don't need to worry about updates, once installed, application will be updated automatically (in the same way as Google Chrome).
